      Terms of Service
      Welcome to Facebook!

      Facebook builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other, build communities and
      grow businesses. These Terms govern your use of Facebook, Messenger and the other products, features, apps,
      services, technologies and software that we offer (the Facebook Products or Products), except where we expressly
      state that separate terms (and not these) apply. These Products are provided to you by Facebook, Inc.

      We don't charge you to use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms. Instead, businesses
      and organisations pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using our Products, you agree that we
      can show you ads that we think will be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data to help
      determine which ads to show you.

      We don't sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don't share information that directly identifies you (such
      as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission.
      Instead, advertisers can tell us things such as the kind of audience that they want to see their ads, and we show
      those ads to people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads
      that help them understand how people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to learn more.

      Our Data Policy explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some of the ads that you see and
      provide all of the other services described below. You can also go to your settings at any time to review the
      privacy choices you have about how we use your data.
      Return to top
      1. The services we provide
      Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help advance
      this mission, we provide the products and services described below to you:
      Provide a personalised experience for you:
      Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events, ads and other content that
      you see in News Feed or our video platform to the Pages that you follow and other features that you might use,
      such as Trending, Marketplace and search. We use the data that we have – for example, about the connections you
      make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products – to personalise your
      experience.
      Connect you with people and organisations that you care about:
      We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that matter to you across
      the Facebook Products that you use. We use the data that we have to make suggestions for you and others – for
      example, groups to join, events to attend, Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch and people who you
      may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe that our services are
      most useful when people are connected to people, groups and organisations that they care about.
      Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:
      There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook and to communicate with friends, family and others about what
      matters to you – for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos and stories across the Facebook Products that
      you use, sending messages to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your
      profile. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented
      reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Facebook.
      Help you discover content, products and services that may interest you:
      We show you ads, offers and other sponsored content to help you discover content, products and services that are
      offered by the many businesses and organisations that use Facebook and other Facebook Products. Section 2 below
      explains this in more detail.
      Combat harmful conduct, and protect and support our community:
      People will only build community on Facebook if they feel safe. We employ dedicated teams around the world and
      develop advanced technical systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others and situations
      where we may be able to help support or protect our community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we
      will take appropriate action – for example, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to
      certain features, disabling an account or contacting law enforcement. We share data with other Facebook Companies
      when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products.
      Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:
      We use and develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems and augmented
      reality so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. For
      example, technology such as this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or
      videos shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help
      more people connect to the Internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our
      ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our
      Products.
      Research ways to make our services better:
      We engage in research to develop, test and improve our Products. This includes analysing the data we have about
      our users and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and
      troubleshooting new features. Our Data Policy explains how we use data to support this research for the purposes
      of developing and improving our services.
      Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the Facebook Company Products:
      Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that are
      important to you. We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different
      Facebook Company Products that you use. For example, we use data about the people you engage with on Facebook to
      make it easier for you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you to communicate with
      businesses that you follow on Facebook through Messenger.
      Enable global access to our services:
      To operate our global service, we need to store and distribute content and data in our data centres and systems
      around the world, including outside your country of residence. This infrastructure may be operated or controlled
      by Facebook, Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited or its affiliates.
      Return to top
      2. How our services are funded
      Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using the Facebook Products
      covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on
      and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and
      interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
      Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our ad system. This means that we can show you
      relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow
      advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal, and the kind of audience that they want to see their
      ads (for example, people between the ages of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who might be
      interested.
      We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are
      interacting with their content on and off Facebook. For example, we provide general demographic and interest
      information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in
      Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information
      that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact
      you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Facebook ads work
      here.
      We collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above for you. You can learn
      about how we collect and use your data in our Data Policy. You have controls over the types of ads and advertisers
      you see, and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show you. Learn more.
      Return to top
      3. Your commitments to Facebook and our community
      We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the
      following commitments:
      1. Who can use Facebook
      When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable. For this reason,
      you must:
      use the same name that you use in everyday life;
      provide accurate information about yourself;
      create only one account (your own) and use your timeline for personal purposes; and
      not share your password, give access to your Facebook account to others or transfer your account to anyone else
      (without our permission).
      We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use Facebook if:
      You are under 13 years old (or the minimum legal age in your country to use our Products).
      You are a convicted sex offender.
      We've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms or Policies.
      You are prohibited from receiving our products, services or software under applicable laws.
      2. What you can share and do on Facebook
      We want people to use Facebook to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at
      the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to
      engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):
      You may not use our Products to do or share anything:
      That breaches these Terms, our Community Standards, and other Terms and Policies that apply to your use of
      Facebook.
      That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent.
      That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights.
      You may not upload viruses or malicious code, or do anything that could disable, overburden or impair the proper
      working or appearance of our Products.
      You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or
      attempt to access data that you do not have permission to access.
      We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions.
      If we remove content that you have shared in violation of our Community Standards, we'll let you know and explain
      any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing
      so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the
      integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical
      limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.
      To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe violates your rights
      (including intellectual property rights) or our terms and policies.
      3. The permissions you give us
      We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:
      Permission to use content that you create and share: Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or
      videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.
      You own the intellectual property rights (things such as copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you
      create and share on Facebook and the other Facebook Company Products you use. Nothing in these Terms takes away
      the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.
      However, to provide our services, we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a ‘licence') to use this
      content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services as described in
      Section 1 above.
      Specifically, when you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in
      connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and
      worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create
      derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This means, for example,
      that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy and share it with others (again,
      consistent with your settings) such as service providers that support our service or other Facebook Products you
      use.This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems.
      You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. Learn more about how to delete your
      account. You can download a copy of your data at any time before deleting your account.
      When you delete content, it's no longer visible to other users; however, it may continue to exist elsewhere on our
      systems where:
      Immediate deletion is not possible due to technical limitations (in which case, your content will be deleted
      within a maximum of 90 days from when you delete it);
      your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case,
      this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
      Where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:
      investigate or identify illegal activity or breaches of our Terms and Policies (for example, to identify or
      investigate misuse of our Products or systems);
      comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
      comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
      in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been
      retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
      In each of the above cases, this licence will continue until the content has been fully deleted.
      Permission to use your name, profile picture and information about your actions with ads and sponsored content:
      You give us permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions that you have taken on
      Facebook next to or in connection with ads, offers and other sponsored content that we display across our
      Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an
      advertised event or have liked a Page created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Facebook. Ads like
      this can be seen only by people who have your permission to see the actions that you've taken on Facebook. You can
      learn more about your ad settings and preferences.
      Permission to update software that you use or download: If you download or use our software, you give us
      permission to download and install updates to the software where available.
      4. Limits on using our intellectual property
      If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products (for
      example, images, designs, videos or sounds that we provide, which you add to content that you create or share on
      Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our copyrights or trademarks (or
      any similar marks) as expressly permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written permission. You
      must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open source licence) to modify, create derivative works
      of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
      Return to top
      4. Additional provisions
      1. Updating our Terms
      We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our
      community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and
      practices. We will only make changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they are incomplete, and
      only if the changes are reasonable and take due account of your interests.
      We will notify you (for example, by email or through our Products) at least 30 days before we make changes to
      these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless changes are required by
      law. Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products.
      We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms and no longer want
      to be part of the Facebook community, you can delete your account at any time.
      2. Account suspension or termination
      We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts
      and ideas.
      If we determine that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including in
      particular our Community Standards, we may suspend or permanently disable access to your account. We may also
      suspend or disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we
      are required to do so for legal reasons.
      Where we take such action, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing
      so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the
      integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; or where we are restricted due to technical
      limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.
      You can learn more about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think that
      we have disabled your account by mistake.
      If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but the
      following provisions will remain in place: 3, 4.2-4.5.
      3. Limits on liability
      We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our
      Products, however, are provided "as is", and we make no guarantees that they will always be safe, secure or
      error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. To the extent permitted by
      law, we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what
      people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline)
      or any content that they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful and other objectionable
      content).
      We cannot predict when issues may arise with our Products. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the
      fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstances will we be liable to you for any lost
      profits, revenues, information or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive or incidental
      damages arising out of or related to these Terms or the Facebook Products, even if we have been advised of the
      possibility of such damages.
      4. Disputes
      We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute
      does arise, however, it's useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.
      If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action or
      dispute that you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Facebook Products, and you
      may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other
      cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of
      California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree that you submit to the personal
      jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the
      State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
      5. Other
      These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between
      you and Facebook, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede any prior agreements.
      Some of the Products that we offer are also governed by supplemental Terms. If you use any of those Products,
      supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For instance, if you
      access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing
      apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our
      Commercial Terms. If you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our Music Guidelines. To the
      extent that any supplemental Terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental Terms shall govern to the extent of
      the conflict.
      If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and
      effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver
      of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.
      You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our consent.
      You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialised. Only your
      legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar document expressing clear consent to
      disclose your content upon death or incapacity will be able to seek disclosure from your account after it is
      memorialised.
      These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these Terms
      are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, or by operation of law or
      otherwise.
      You should know that we may need to change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for example, if
      someone else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name that you use in everyday life). We will
      inform you in advance if we have to do this and explain why.
      We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services. But you should know that
      we may use them without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep
      them confidential.
      We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
      Return to top
      5. Other Terms and Policies that may apply to you
      Community Standards: These guidelines outline our standards regarding the content that you post to Facebook and
      your activity on Facebook and other Facebook Products.
      Commercial Terms: These Terms apply if you also access or use our Products for any commercial or business purpose,
      including advertising, operating an app on our Platform, using our measurement services, managing a group or a
      Page for a business, or selling goods or services.
      Advertising Policies: These Policies specify what types of ad content are allowed by partners who advertise across
      the Facebook Products.

      event, or if you use Facebook to communicate or administer a promotion.

      example, for developers or operators of a platform application or website or if you use social plugins).
      Developer Payment Terms: These Terms apply to developers of applications that use Facebook Payments.
      Community Payment Terms: These Terms apply to payments made on or through Facebook.
      Commerce Policies: These guidelines outline the Policies that apply when you offer products and services for sale

      Terms of Use
      Welcome to Instagram!

      These Terms of Use govern your use of Instagram and provide information about the Instagram Service, outlined
      below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these terms.

      The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook, Inc. These Terms of Use
      therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc.

      The Instagram Service
      We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features,
      applications, services, technologies, and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you
      closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):

      Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share.
      People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences you actually care about.
      So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to
      help you create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,
      features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram,
      based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.
      Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.
      We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive
      and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat
      abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We use all the
      information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information
      about misuse or harmful content with other Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
      Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.
      Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our
      Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service
      on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine
      learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us
      ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
      Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook Company Products.
      Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems, insights, and information-including
      the information we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better,
      safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you use, and
      designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Facebook Company Products.
      Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.
      To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including
      outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook
      Ireland Limited, or their affiliates.
      Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.
      We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you
      ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that
      content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
      Research and innovation.
      We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service
      better and contribute to the well-being of our community.

      The Data Policy
      Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect,
      use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also explains the many ways you can control your
      information, including in the Instagram Privacy and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use
      Instagram.


      Your Commitments
      In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below commitments to us.
      Who Can Use Instagram. We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be
      safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part
      of the Instagram community.
      You must be at least 13 years old or the minimum legal age in your country to use Instagram.
      You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable laws or engaging in payments
      related Services if you are on an applicable denied party listing.
      We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our policies.
      You must not be a convicted sex offender.
      How You Can't Use Instagram. Providing a safe and open Service for a broad community requires that we all do our
      part.
      You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.
      You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up to date
      information (including registration information). Also, you may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't
      create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
      You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorized purpose.
      You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular
      the Instagram Community Guidelines, Instagram Platform Policy, and Music Guidelines. Learn how to report conduct
      or content in our Help Center.
      You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service.
      You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorized ways.
      This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
      You can't attempt to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username) or solicit,
      collect, or use login credentials or badges of other users.
      You can't post private or confidential information or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including
      intellectual property.
      Learn more, including how to report content that you think infringes your intellectual property rights, here.
      You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.
      Permissions You Give to Us. As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the
      Service.
      We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use it.
      Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on
      or through the Service. Instead, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property
      rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive,
      royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy,
      publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy
      and application settings). You can end this license anytime by deleting your content or account. However, content
      will continue to appear if you shared it with others and they have not deleted it. To learn more about how we use
      information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help
      Center.
      Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your relationships and actions with
      accounts, ads, and sponsored content.
      You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about your actions (such as likes)
      or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored
      content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you.
      For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on
      Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and
      follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We
      will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
      You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.

      Additional Rights We Retain
      If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate
      or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
      If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for
      example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all
      rights to our content (but not yours).
      You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand
      Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
      You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to modify, create derivative works of,
      decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.

      Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account
      We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of
      Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law.
      We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling
      your account) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us,
      violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly
      infringe other people's intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so by law. If we
      take action to disable or terminate your account, we will notify you where appropriate. If you believe your
      account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help
      Center.
      Content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies and will still be visible where
      others have shared it. This paragraph, and the section below called "Our Agreement and What Happens if We
      Disagree," will still apply even after your account is terminated or deleted.

      Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree
      Our Agreement.
      Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to
      our Platform Policy. If you use certain other features or related services, additional terms will be made
      available and will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be
      asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other
      terms will govern.
      If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
      Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of
      this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
      We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
      Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.
      This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
      You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
      Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as
      in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.

      Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.
      Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or will work perfectly all the
      time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE
      IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
      We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible for their (or your) actions or
      conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t
      responsible for services and features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our
      Service.
      Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is limited as much as the
      law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't know what all the possible impacts might be. You
      agree that we won't be responsible ("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or
      consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these
      Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content, information, or account.
      How We Will Handle Disputes.
      If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action, or
      dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms ("claim"), and you may resolve your claim
      in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree that
      the claim must be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a
      state court located in San Mateo County, that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts
      for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms
      and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
      Unsolicited Material.
      We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to
      compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.

      Updating These Terms
      We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately
      reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our
      Service) before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into
      effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to
      agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here.

    <div class="tos tos__item tos__item--snapchat">
      Snap Inc. Terms of Service
      (If you live in the United States)

      Effective: October 30, 2019

      Welcome!
      We’ve drafted these Terms of Service (which we call the “Terms”) so you’ll know the rules that govern our
      relationship with you. Although we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places
      where these Terms may still read like a traditional contract. There’s a good reason for that: These Terms do
      indeed form a legally binding contract between you and Snap Inc. So please read them carefully.

      By using Snapchat, Bitmoji, or any of our other products or services that link to these Terms (we refer to these
      collectively as the “Services”), you agree to the Terms. Of course, if you don’t agree with them, then don’t use
      the Services.

      ARBITRATION NOTICE: THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE A LITTLE LATER ON. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF
      DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE, YOU AND SNAP INC. AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED
      BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT
      OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

      1. Who Can Use the Services
      No one under 13 is allowed to create an account or use the Services. We may offer additional Services with
      additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them. So please read all terms carefully.

      By using the Services, you state that:

      You can form a binding contract with Snap Inc.
      You are not a person who is barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or any other
      applicable jurisdiction—including, for example, that you do not appear on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of
      Specially Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition.
      You are not a convicted sex offender.
      You will comply with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and
      regulations.
      If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other entity, you state that you are authorized to
      grant all licenses set forth in these Terms and to agree to these Terms on behalf of the business or entity. If
      you are using the Services on behalf of an entity of the U.S. Government, you agree to the Amendment to Snap Inc.
      Terms of Service for U.S. Government Users.

      2. Rights We Grant You
      Snap Inc. grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, nonexclusive, revocable, and
      non-sublicensable license to access and use the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of letting you use
      and enjoy the Services’ benefits in a way that these Terms and our usage policies, such as our Community
      Guidelines, allow.

      The Services include Bitmoji, which allows you to assemble an avatar using visual elements we provide (a “Bitmoji
      Avatar”). All Bitmoji Avatars are owned exclusively by Snap Inc., and we reserve the right to use any Bitmoji
      Avatars for any purpose, including to promote our products and services.

      Any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features.
      You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device’s settings.

      You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services, nor may you reverse engineer or
      attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have our
      written permission to do so.

      3. Rights You Grant Us
      Many of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. When you do that, you retain
      whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a license to use that content.
      How broad that license is depends on which Services you use and the Settings you have selected.

      We call Story submissions that are set to be viewable by Everyone as well as content you submit to crowd-sourced
      Services, including Our Story, “Public Content.” For all content you submit to the Services other than Public
      Content, you grant Snap Inc. and our affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license
      to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that content. This license
      is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and
      researching and developing new ones.

      Because Public Content is inherently public and chronicles matters of public interest, the license you grant us
      for this content is broader. For Public Content, you grant Snap Inc., our affiliates, and our business partners
      all of the same rights you grant for non-Public Content in the previous paragraph, as well as a perpetual license
      to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, publicly perform, and publicly display
      Public Content in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed). To the
      extent it’s necessary, when you appear in, create, upload, post, or send Public Content, you also grant Snap Inc.,
      our affiliates, and our business partners the unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual right and license to use your
      name, likeness, and voice, including in connection with commercial or sponsored content. This means, among other
      things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation from Snap Inc., our affiliates, or our business partners
      if your name, likeness, or voice is conveyed through the Services, either on the Snapchat application or on one of
      our business partner’s platforms.

      For information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at our Privacy Policy and
      Support Site.

      While we’re not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time and for any
      reason, including to provide and develop the Services or if we think your content violates these Terms. You alone,
      though, remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send, or store through the Service.

      The Services may contain advertisements. In consideration for Snap Inc. letting you access and use the Services,
      you agree that we, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on the Services. Because the
      Services contain content that you and other users provide us, advertising may sometimes appear near your content.

      With respect to your use of Bitmoji, you grant Snap Inc., our affiliates, and our business partners a worldwide,
      perpetual, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify,
      adapt, edit, publish, distribute, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, publicly perform, and distribute (a) any
      actual or simulated likeness, image, voice, name, poses, or other personal characteristics (collectively, your
      “Likeness”) embodied in a Bitmoji Avatar or the Bitmoji Services, and (b) any materials you create using the
      Bitmoji Services, as well as the right to create and use derivative works from those materials, in any and all
      media or distribution methods (now known or later developed). This license is for the limited purpose of
      operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones.
      This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation from Snap Inc., our affiliates,
      or our business partners if your name, likeness, or voice is conveyed through or in connection with Bitmoji,
      either on the Bitmoji application or on one of our business partner’s platforms.

      Should you develop or be deemed to have any rights in a Bitmoji Avatar not granted by these Terms, you agree to
      irrevocably and unconditionally assign to Snap Inc. all of your additional right, title, and interest, including
      all copyrights, in and to such Bitmoji Avatar.

      We always love to hear from our users. But if you provide feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use them
      without compensating you, and without any restriction or obligation to you.

      4. The Content of Others
      Much of the content on our Services is produced by users, publishers, and other third parties. Whether that
      content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the person or organization
      that submitted it. Although Snap Inc. reserves the right to review or remove all content that appears on the
      Services, we do not necessarily review all of it. So we cannot—and do not—take responsibility for any content that
      others provide through the Services.

      Through these Terms and our Community Guidelines, we make clear that we do not want the Services put to bad uses.
      But because we do not review all content, we cannot guarantee that content on the Services, or that our users’ use
      of our Services, will always conform to our Terms or Guidelines.

      5. Privacy
      Your privacy matters to us. You can learn how we handle your information when you use our Services by reading our
      Privacy Policy. We encourage you to give the Privacy Policy a careful look because, by using our Services, you
      agree that Snap Inc. can collect, use, and share your information consistent with that policy.

      6. Respecting Others' Rights
      Snap Inc. respects the rights of others. And so should you. You therefore may not use the Services, or enable
      anyone else to use the Services, in a manner that:

      violates or infringes someone else’s rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual
      property right.
      bullies, harasses, or intimidates.
      defames.
      spams or solicits our users.
      You must also respect Snap Inc.’s rights and adhere to the Brand Guidelines, Bitmoji Brand Guidelines and any
      other brand guidelines published by Snap Inc. You may not do any of the following (or enable anyone else to do
      so):

      use branding, logos, icons, user interface elements, designs, photographs, videos, or any other materials used in
      our Services, except as explicitly allowed by the Brand Guidelines, Bitmoji Brand Guidelines or other brand
      guidelines published by Snap Inc.
      violate or infringe Snap Inc.’s copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights.
      copy, archive, download, upload, distribute, syndicate, broadcast, perform, display, make available, or otherwise
      use any portion of the Services or the content on the Services except as set forth in these Terms.
      use the Services, any tools provided by the Services, or any content on the Services for any commercial purposes
      without our consent.
      In short: You may not use the Services or the content on the Services in ways that are not authorized by these
      Terms. Nor may you help anyone else in doing so.

      7. Respecting Copyright
      Snap Inc. honors copyright laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. We therefore take reasonable
      steps to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of. And if Snap Inc.
      becomes aware that one of its users has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we will take reasonable steps within our
      power to terminate the user’s account.

      We make it easy for you to report suspected copyright infringement. If you believe that anything on the Services
      infringes a copyright that you own or control, please report it using the form accessible through this tool. Or
      you may file a notice with our designated agent:

      Snap Inc.
      Attn: Copyright Agent
      2772 Donald Douglas Loop North
      Santa Monica, CA 90405
      email: copyright@snap.com

      Don’t use this email address for anything other than reporting copyright infringement, as such emails will be
      ignored. To report other forms of infringement, please use the tool accessible here.

      If you file a notice with our Copyright Agent, it must comply with the requirements set forth at 17 U.S.C. §
      512(c)(3). That means the notice must:

      contain the physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
      identify the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.
      identify the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to
      be removed, or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to let us locate the
      material.
      provide your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address.
      provide a personal statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner
      complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
      provide a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you
      are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
      8. Safety
      We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. But we can’t guarantee it. That’s where you come in.
      By using the Services, you agree that:

      You will not use the Services for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited in these Terms.
      You will not use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means or interface to access the Services
      or extract other user’s information.
      You will not use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Services or other users’ content
      or information without our written consent.
      You will not use the Services in a way that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other
      users from fully enjoying the Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of
      the Services.
      You will not use or attempt to use another user’s account, username, or password without their permission.
      You will not solicit login credentials from another user.
      You will not post content that contains or links to pornography, graphic violence, threats, hate speech, or
      incitements to violence.
      You will not upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise the security of the Services.
      You will not attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we employ, or attempt to access areas or
      features of the Services that you are not authorized to access.
      You will not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our Services or any system or network.
      You will not encourage or promote any activity that violates these Terms.
      We also care about your safety while using our Services. So do not use our Services in a way that would distract
      you from obeying traffic or safety laws. For example, never Snap and drive. And never put yourself or others in
      harm’s way just to capture a Snap.

      9. Your Account
      You are responsible for any activity that occurs in your Snapchat account. So it’s important that you keep your
      account secure. One way to do that is to select a strong password that you don’t use for any other account.

      By using the Services, you agree that, in addition to exercising common sense:

      You will not create more than one account for yourself.
      You will not create another account if we have already disabled your account, unless you have our written
      permission to do so.
      You will not buy, sell, rent, or lease access to your Snapchat account, Snaps, a Snapchat username, or a friend
      link without our written permission.
      You will not share your password.
      You will not log in or attempt to access the Services through unauthorized third-party applications or clients.
      If you think that someone has gained access to your account, please immediately reach out to Snapchat Support.

      10. Memories
      Memories is our data-storage service that makes it easier for you to reminisce anytime, anywhere. By agreeing to
      these Terms, you automatically enable Memories. Once Memories is enabled, it will remain enabled for as long as
      you maintain your Snapchat account. But you can always turn off certain Memories features through Settings.

      One of the options we provide with Memories is the ability to create a restricted area by setting a passcode,
      which might be a PIN or a passphrase or some other mechanism. This is similar to the device-lock option you may be
      using on your mobile device; by setting a passcode, you make it less likely that another person who gets ahold of
      your device will be able to see what you saved to the restricted area of Memories. But here’s a big warning: IF
      YOU LOSE OR FORGET YOUR MEMORIES PASSCODE, OR IF YOU ENTER THE WRONG ONE TOO MANY TIMES, YOU WILL LOSE ACCESS TO
      ANY CONTENT YOU SAVED IN THE RESTRICTED AREA OF MEMORIES. We don’t offer any passcode recovery features for this
      restricted area. You are solely responsible for remembering your passcode. Please go to our Support Site for more
      details on passcodes.

      Your content in Memories might become unavailable for any number of reasons, including things like an operational
      glitch or a decision on our end to terminate your account. Since we can’t promise that your content will always be
      available, we recommend keeping a separate copy of content you save to Memories.

      We make no promise that Memories will be able to accommodate your precise storage needs. We reserve the right to
      set storage limits for Memories, and we may change these limits from time to time in our sole discretion. And just
      as with our other Services, your use of Memories may take up space on your device and may incur mobile data
      charges.

      You may not resell any Memories features. This means you can’t do something like use Memories to operate your own
      file-storage or distribution service for other people.

      11. Data Charges and Mobile Phones
      You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our Services, including text-messaging and
      data charges. If you’re unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using the
      Services.

      If you change or deactivate the mobile phone number that you used to create a Snapchat account, you must update
      your account information through Settings within 72 hours to prevent us from sending to someone else messages
      intended for you.

      12. Third-Party Services
      If you use a service, feature, or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available through our
      Services (including Services we jointly offer with the third party), each party’s terms will govern the respective
      party’s relationship with you. Snap Inc. is not responsible or liable for a third party’s terms or actions taken
      under the third party’s terms.

      13. Modifying the Services and Termination
      We’re relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones all the time. That means we may add or remove
      features, products, or functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether. We may take any
      of these actions at any time, and when we do, we may not provide you with any notice beforehand.

      While we hope you remain a lifelong Snapchatter, you can terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by
      deleting your account.

      Snap Inc. may also terminate these Terms with you at any time, for any reason, and without advanced notice. That
      means that we may stop providing you with any Services, or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use
      our Services. For example, we may deactivate your account due to prolonged inactivity, and we may reclaim your
      username at any time for any reason.

      Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and Snap Inc. continue to be bound by Sections 3, 6, 9, 10, and
      13-22 of the Terms.

      14. Indemnity
      You agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Snap Inc., our affiliates,
      directors, officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, and agents from and against any and all complaints,
      charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) due to, arising out
      of, or relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your content; and (c) your breach of
      these Terms.

      15. Disclaimers
      We try to keep the Services up and running and free of annoyances. But we make no promises that we will succeed.

      THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY
      KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR
      A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, WHILE SNAP INC. ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A GOOD USER
      EXPERIENCE, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT: (A) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE, ERROR-FREE, OR TIMELY;
      (B) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS FUNCTION WITHOUT DELAYS, DISRUPTIONS, OR IMPERFECTIONS; OR (C) THAT ANY CONTENT, USER
      CONTENT, OR INFORMATION YOU OBTAIN ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL BE TIMELY OR ACCURATE.

      SNAP INC. TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY AND ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR ANY CONTENT THAT YOU, ANOTHER USER, OR A THIRD
      PARTY CREATES, UPLOADS, POSTS, SENDS, RECEIVES, OR STORES ON OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE
      THAT YOU MAY BE EXPOSED TO CONTENT THAT MIGHT BE OFFENSIVE, ILLEGAL, MISLEADING, OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATE, NONE
      OF WHICH SNAP INC. WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR.

      16. Limitation of Liability
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SNAP INC. AND OUR MANAGING MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES,
      LICENSORS, AGENTS, AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
      PUNITIVE, OR MULTIPLE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY
      LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY
      TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (B) THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES ON OR THROUGH THE
      SERVICES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT, EVEN IF SNAP INC. HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
      THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL SNAP INC.’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE
      SERVICES EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 USD OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID SNAP INC., IF ANY, IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS.

      17. Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver
      PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU AND SNAP INC. TO AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL
      DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.

      Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You and Snap Inc. agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract,
      tort, or otherwise), including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Terms or the
      use of the Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an
      individual basis, except that you and Snap Inc. are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party
      seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets,
      or patents. To be clear: The phrase “all claims and disputes” also includes claims and disputes that arose between
      us before the effective date of these Terms.
      Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
      dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”)
      and will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, available here as of the date of these Terms, or by
      calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an
      alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to
      the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral
      arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through
      binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where
      the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum’s
      rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
      Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be
      conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be
      chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the
      parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.
      Fees. If you choose to arbitrate with Snap Inc., you will not have to pay any fees to do so. That is because Snap
      Inc. will reimburse you for your filing fee and the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules provide that any hearing fees
      and arbitrator compensation are our responsibility. To the extent another arbitral forum is selected, Snap Inc.
      will pay that forum’s fees as well.
      Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and
      liabilities, if any, of you and Snap Inc. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined
      with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or
      part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any
      non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms. The
      arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions
      on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same
      authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the
      arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Snap Inc.
      Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A
      TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Snap Inc. are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved
      by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules
      applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Snap Inc.
      over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and
      elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.
      Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
      MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER
      OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If,
      however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are
      entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 18.
      Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this arbitration agreement may be waived by the party
      against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this arbitration
      agreement.
      Opt-out. You may opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Snap Inc. can force the
      other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Snap Inc. in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming
      subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Snapchat username and
      the email address you used to set up your Snapchat account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that
      you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. You must either mail your opt-out notice to this address: Snap
      Inc., ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out, 2772 Donald Douglas Loop North, Santa Monica, CA 90405, or email the opt-out
      notice to arbitration-opt-out@snap.com.
      Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Snap Inc. may bring an individual action in small
      claims court.
      Arbitration Agreement Survival. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with
      Snap Inc.
      18. Exclusive Venue
      To the extent that these Terms allow you or Snap Inc. to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Snap Inc.
      agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including statutory claims and
      disputes, arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in the
      United States District Court for the Central District of California. If, however, that court would lack original
      jurisdiction over the litigation, then all such claims and disputes will be litigated exclusively in the Superior
      Court of California, County of Los Angeles. You and Snap Inc. consent to the personal jurisdiction of both courts.

      19. Choice of Law
      Except to the extent they are preempted by U.S. federal law, the laws of California, other than its
      conflict-of-laws principles, govern these Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise)
      arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter.

      20. Severability
      If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these Terms and
      not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

      21. Additional Terms for Specific Services
      Given the breadth of our Services, we sometimes need to craft additional terms and conditions for specific
      Services. Those additional terms and conditions, which will be available with the relevant Services, then become
      part of your agreement with us if you use those Services. If any part of those additional terms and conditions
      conflicts with these Terms, the additional terms and conditions will prevail.

      22. Final Terms
      These Terms (together with any additional terms applicable to specific Services you use) make up the entire
      agreement between you and Snap Inc., and supersede any prior agreements.
      These Terms do not create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights.
      If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.
      We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
      You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent.

      Snap Group Limited Terms of Service
      (If you live outside the United States)

      Effective: October 30, 2019

      Welcome!
      We’ve drafted these Terms of Service (which we call the “Terms”) so you’ll know the rules that govern our
      relationship with you. Although we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places
      where these Terms may still read like a traditional contract. There’s a good reason for that: these Terms do
      indeed form a legally binding contract between you and Snap Group Limited. So please read them carefully.

      In order to use Snapchat, Bitmoji, or any of our other products or services that link to these Terms (we refer to
      these collectively as the “Services”), you must have accepted our Terms and Privacy Policy, which are presented to
      you (i) when you first open the app and (ii) when we make any material changes to the Terms or the Privacy Policy.
      Of course, if you don’t accept them, then don’t use the Services.

      These Terms apply to you if you live outside the United States or if you are using the Services on behalf of a
      business located outside the United States. If you live in the United States or are using the Services on behalf
      of a business located there, the Snap Inc. Terms of Service apply.

      ARBITRATION NOTICE: IF YOU’RE USING THE SERVICES ON BEHALF OF A BUSINESS, THEN YOUR BUSINESS WILL BE BOUND BY THE
      ARBITRATION CLAUSE THAT APPEARS LATER IN THESE TERMS.

      1. Who can use the Services
      No one under 13 is allowed to create an account or use the Services. We may offer additional Services with
      additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them. So please read all terms carefully.

      By using the Services, you state that:

      you can form a binding contract with Snap Group Limited.
      you are not a person who is barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States, the United
      Kingdom, or any other applicable jurisdiction—including, for example, that you do not appear on the U.S. Treasury
      Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition.
      you are not a convicted sex offender.
      you will comply with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and
      regulations.
      If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other entity, you state that you are authorised to
      grant all licences set out in these Terms and to agree to these Terms on behalf of the business or entity.

      2. Rights we grant you
      Snap Group Limited grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, revocable, and
      non-sublicensable licence to access and use the Services. This licence is for the sole purpose of letting you use
      and enjoy the Services’ benefits in a way that these Terms and our usage policies, such as our Community
      Guidelines, allow.

      The Services include Bitmoji, which allows you to assemble an avatar using visual elements we provide (a “Bitmoji
      Avatar”). All Bitmoji Avatars are owned exclusively by Snap Group Limited (or its affiliates), and we reserve the
      right to use any Bitmoji Avatars for any purpose, including to promote our products and services.

      Any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features.
      You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device’s settings.

      You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services. Nor may you reverse engineer or
      attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have our
      written permission to do so.

      3. Rights you grant us
      Many of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. When you do that, you retain
      whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a licence to use that content.
      How broad that licence is depends on which Services you use and the settings you have selected.

      We call Story submissions that are set to be viewable by Everyone as well as content you submit to crowd-sourced
      Services, including Our Story, “Public Content.” For all content you submit to the Services other than Public
      Content, you grant Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc., and our affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and
      transferable licence to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that
      content for as long as you use the Services. This licence is for the limited purpose of operating, developing,
      providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones.

      Because Public Content is public by nature and records matters of public interest, the licence you grant us for
      this content is broader. For Public Content, you grant Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc., our affiliates, and our
      business partners all of the same rights you grant for non-Public Content in the previous paragraph, as well as a
      licence to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, publicly perform and publicly
      display Public Content in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later
      developed). To the extent it’s necessary, when you appear in, create, upload, post, or send Public Content, you
      also grant Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc., our affiliates, and our business partners the unrestricted, worldwide
      right and licence to use your name, likeness, and voice. This means, among other things, that you will not be
      entitled to any compensation from Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc., our affiliates, or our business partners if your
      name, likeness, or voice is conveyed through the Services, either on the Snapchat application or on one of our
      business partners’ platforms.

      For more information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at our Privacy Policy and
      Support Site.

      We reserve the right to delete any content (i) which we think violates these Terms or our Community Guidelines, or
      (ii) if necessary to comply with our legal obligations. However, you alone, remain responsible for the content you
      create, upload, post, send, or store through the Services.

      The Services may contain advertisements. In consideration for Snap Group Limited letting you access and use the
      Services, you agree that we, Snap Inc., our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on the
      Services, including personalised advertising based upon the information you provide us or we collect or obtain
      about you. Because the Services contain content that you and other users provide us, advertising may sometimes
      appear near, between, over, or in your content.

      With respect to your use of Bitmoji, you grant Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc., and our affiliates and business
      partners a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable licence to host, store, use,
      display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, distribute, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, publicly
      perform, and distribute (a) any actual or simulated likeness, image, voice, name, poses, or other personal
      characteristics (collectively, your “Likeness”) embodied in a Bitmoji Avatar or the Bitmoji Services, and (b) any
      materials you create using the Bitmoji Services, as well as the right to create and use derivative works from
      those materials, in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed). This licence is for
      the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and
      developing new ones. This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation from Snap
      Group Limited, Snap Inc., our affiliates, or our business partners if your name, likeness, or voice is conveyed
      through or in connection with Bitmoji, either on the Bitmoji application or on one of our business partner’s
      platforms.

      Should you develop or be deemed to have any rights in a Bitmoji Avatar, you irrevocably and unconditionally assign
      (and in the case of copyright, by way of a present assignment of future copyright) to Snap Group Limited
      absolutely, with full title guarantee and free from any encumbrances, all of your right, title, and interest in
      and to such Bitmoji Avatar.

      To the extent permissible by law, you irrevocably waive – or agree not to assert against Snap Group Limited or its
      affiliates to the extent a waiver is not permitted – any moral rights or equivalent rights you may have in the
      Bitmoji Avatar throughout the world.

      While we're not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and delete any Bitmoji Avatar at any time and
      for any reason. However, you alone remain responsible for your use of the Bitmoji Avatar that you create through
      our Services.

      We always love to hear from our users. But if you provide feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use them
      without compensating you, and without any restriction or obligation to you.

      4. The content of others
      Much of the content on our Services is produced by users, publishers, and other third parties. Whether that
      content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the person or organisation
      that submitted it. Although Snap Group Limited reserves the right to review all content that appears on the
      Services and to remove any content that violates these Terms, our Community Guidelines or the law, we do not
      necessarily review all of it.

      Through these Terms and our Community Guidelines, we make clear that we don't want the Services to be put to bad
      uses. But because we don't review all content, we cannot guarantee that content on the Services, or that our
      users’ use of our Services, will always conform to our Terms or Guidelines.

      5. Privacy
      Your privacy matters to us. You can learn how your information is handled when you use our Services by reading the
      Privacy Policy.

      6. Respecting others' rights
      Snap Group Limited respects the rights of others. And so should you. You therefore may not use the Services, or
      enable anyone else to use the Services, in a manner that:

      violates or infringes someone else’s rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark, or other
      intellectual-property right;
      bullies, harasses, or intimidates;
      defames;
      spams or solicits our users.
      You must also respect Snap Inc.’s rights and adhere to the Brand Guidelines, Bitmoji Brand Guidelines, and any
      other brand guidelines published by Snap Inc. You may not do any of the following (or enable anyone else to do
      so).

      use branding, logos, icons, user interface, designs, photographs, videos, or any other materials used in our
      Services, except as explicitly allowed by the Brand Guidelines, Bitmoji Brand Guidelines, or other brand
      guidelines published by Snap Inc.
      violate or infringe Snap Inc.’s copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights.
      copy, archive, download, upload, distribute, syndicate, broadcast, perform, display, make available, or otherwise
      use any portion of the Services or the content on the Services except as set forth in these Terms.
      use the Services, any tools provided by the Services, or any content on the Services for any commercial purposes
      without our consent.
      In short: You may not use the Services or the content on the Services in ways that are not authorised by these
      Terms. Nor may you help anyone else in doing so.

      7. Respecting copyright
      Snap Group Limited honors copyright laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. We therefore take
      reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of. And if
      Snap Group Limited becomes aware that one of its users has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we will take
      reasonable steps within our power to terminate the user’s account.

      We make it easy for you to report suspected copyright infringement. If you believe that anything on the Services
      infringes a copyright that you own or control, please report it using the form accessible through this tool. Or
      you may file a notice with our designated agent:

      Snap Inc.
      Attn: Copyright Agent
      2772 Donald Douglas Loop North
      Santa Monica, CA 90405
      email: copyright@snap.com

      Don’t use this email address for anything other than reporting copyright infringement, as such emails will be
      ignored. To report other forms of infringement, please use the tool accessible here.

      If you file a notice with our Copyright Agent, it must:

      contain the physical or electronic signature of a person authorised to act on behalf of the copyright owner;
      identify the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed;
      identify the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to
      be removed, or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to let us locate the
      material;
      provide your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address;
      provide a personal statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner
      complained of is not authorised by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
      provide a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you
      are authorised to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
      8. Safety
      We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. But we can’t guarantee it. That’s where you come in.
      By using the Services, you agree that:

      You will not use the Services for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited in these Terms.
      You will not use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means or interface to access the Services
      or extract other users’ information.
      You will not use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Services or other users’ content
      or information without our written consent.
      You will not use the Services in a way that could interfere with, disrupt, affect negatively, or inhibit other
      users from fully enjoying the Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of
      the Services.
      You will not use or attempt to use another user’s account, username, or password without their permission.
      You will not solicit login credentials from another user.
      You will not post content that contains pornography, graphic violence, threats, hate speech, or incitements to
      violence.
      You will not upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise the security of the Services.
      You will not attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we employ, or attempt to access areas or
      features of the Services that you are not authorised to access.
      You will not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our Services or any system or network.
      You will not encourage or promote any activity that violates these Terms.
      We also care about your safety while using our Services. So do not use our Services in a way that would distract
      you from obeying traffic or safety laws. For example, never Snap and drive. And never put yourself or others in
      harm’s way just to capture a Snap.

      9. Your account
      You are responsible for any activity that occurs in your Snapchat account. So it’s important that you keep your
      account secure. One way to do that is to select a strong password that you don’t use for any other account.

      By using the Services, you agree that, in addition to exercising common sense:

      You will not create more than 1 account for yourself.
      You will not create another account if we have already disabled your account, unless you have our written
      permission to do so.
      You will not buy, sell, rent or lease access to your Snapchat account, Snaps, a Snapchat username or a friend link
      without our written permission.
      You will not share your password.
      You will not log in or attempt to access the Services through unauthorised third-party applications or clients.
      If you think that someone has gained access to your account, please reach out immediately to Snapchat Support.

      10. Memories
      Memories is our data-storage service that makes it easier for you to reminisce anytime, anywhere. By agreeing to
      these Terms, you automatically enable Memories. Once Memories is enabled, it will remain enabled for as long as
      you maintain your Snapchat account. But you can always turn off certain Memories features through Settings.

      One of the options we provide with Memories is the ability to create a restricted area by setting a passcode,
      which might be a PIN or a passphrase or some other mechanism. This is similar to the device-lock option you may be
      using on your mobile device; by setting a passcode, you make it less likely that another person who gets hold of
      your device will be able to see what you saved to the restricted area of Memories. But here’s a big warning: if
      you lose or forget your Memories passcode, or if you enter the wrong one too many times, you will lose access to
      any content you saved in the restricted area of Memories. We don’t offer any passcode recovery features for this
      restricted area. You are solely responsible for remembering your passcode. Please go to our Support Site for more
      details on passcodes.

      Your content in Memories might become unavailable for any number of reasons, including things such as an
      operational glitch or a decision to terminate your account at our end. As we can’t promise that your content will
      always be available, we recommend keeping a separate copy of the content you save to Memories.

      We make no promise that Memories will be able to accommodate your precise storage needs. We reserve the right to
      set storage limits for Memories, and we may change these limits from time to time at our sole discretion. And just
      as with our other Services, your use of Memories may take up space on your device and may incur mobile data
      charges.

      You may not resell any Memories features. This means you can’t do something like use Memories to operate your own
      file-storage or distribution service for other people.

      11. Data charges and mobile phones
      You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our Services, including text-messaging and
      data charges. If you’re unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using the
      Services.

      If you change or deactivate the mobile phone number that you used to create a Snapchat account, you must update
      your account information through Settings within 72 hours to prevent us from sending to someone else messages
      intended for you.

      12. Third-party services
      If you use a service, feature or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available through our
      Services (including Services we offer jointly with the third party), each party’s terms will govern the respective
      party’s relationship with you. Neither Snap Group Limited nor Snap Inc. is responsible or liable for a third
      party’s terms or actions taken under the third party’s terms.

      13. Modifying the Services and termination
      We’re relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones all the time. This means that we may add or remove
      features, products, or functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether. We may take any
      of these actions at any time, and when we do, we will try to notify you beforehand - but this won’t always be
      possible.

      Though we hope you remain a lifelong Snapchatter, you can terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by
      deleting your account.

      Snap Group Limited may also terminate these Terms with you if you fail to comply with these Terms, our Community
      Guidelines or the law, or for any reason outside of our control. And while we’ll try to give you advance notice,
      we can’t guarantee it. Our right to terminate these Terms means that we may stop providing you with any Services,
      or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use the Services. For example, we may deactivate your
      account due to prolonged inactivity, and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason.

      Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and Snap Group Limited continue to be bound by Sections 3, 6,
      9, 10 and 13-22 of the Terms.

      14. Indemnity
      You agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc.
      and our affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, suppliers, and agents from and
      against any complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys’
      fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your
      content; and (c) your breach of these Terms.

      15. Disclaimers
      We try to keep the Services up and running and free of annoyances. But we cannot promise that we will always
      succeed.

      The Services are provided “as is” and “as available” and to the extent permitted by law without warranties of any
      kind, either express or implied, including, in particular implied warranties, conditions, or other terms relating
      to (i) merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, title, quiet enjoyment,
      non-infringement, or (ii) arising from a course of dealing. In addition, while Snap Group Limited attempts to
      provide a good user experience, we do not represent or warrant that: (a) the Services will always be secure,
      error-free or timely; (b) the Services will always function without delays, disruption or imperfections; or (c)
      that any content or information you obtain through the Services will be timely or accurate.

      IF THE LAW OF THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU LIVE DOES NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSIONS OF LIABILITY PROVIDED FOR IN THIS CLAUSE,
      THOSE EXCLUSIONS SHALL NOT APPLY.

      Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc., and their affiliates take no responsibility and assume no liability for any content
      that you, another user, or a third party creates, uploads, posts, sends, receives, or stores on or through our
      Services. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to content that might be offensive, illegal,
      misleading, or otherwise inappropriate, none of which Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc., nor their affiliates will be
      responsible for.

      Nothing in these Terms will exclude or limit any responsibility we may have to remove content if so required by
      the law of the country where you live.

      16. Limitation of liability
      Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc. and our affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, employees, licensors,
      suppliers, and agents will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, or
      multiple damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of
      data, use, goodwill or other intangible losses, resulting from: (a) your use of the Services or inability to use
      the Services; (b) your access to or inability to access the Services; (c) the conduct or content of other users or
      third parties on or through the Services; or (d) unauthorised access, use or alteration of your content. In no
      event will Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc. or their affiliates’ aggregate liability for all claims relating to the
      Services exceed the greater of €100 EUR or the amount you paid Snap Group Limited in the last 12 months for any
      paid Services.

      IF THE LAW OF THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU LIVE DOES NOT ALLOW ANY LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVIDED FOR IN THIS CLAUSE,
      THAT LIMITATION WILL NOT APPLY.

      17. Dispute resolution, arbitration
      If you have a concern, let’s talk. Go ahead and contact us first and we’ll do our best to resolve the issue.

      Some of our Services may have additional terms that contain dispute-resolution provisions unique to that Service
      or your residency.

      If you are using the Services on behalf of a business (rather than for your personal use), you and Snap Group
      Limited agree that to the extent permitted by law, all claims and disputes between us arising out of or relating
      to these Terms or the use of the Services will be finally settled under the LCIA Arbitration Rules, which are
      incorporated by reference into this clause. There will be one arbitrator (to be appointed by the LCIA), the
      arbitration will take place in London, and the arbitration will be conducted in English. If you do not wish to
      agree to this clause, you must not use the Services.

      18. Exclusive venue
      To the extent the parties are permitted under these Terms to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Snap
      Group Limited agree that all claims and disputes (whether contractual or otherwise) arising out of or relating to
      the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in the courts of England in the United Kingdom,
      unless this is prohibited by the laws of the country where you reside. You and Snap Group Limited consent to the
      exclusive jurisdiction of those courts.

      19. Choice of law
      The laws of England and Wales govern these Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contractual or otherwise)
      arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter. The courts in some countries may not apply the
      laws of England and Wales to some disputes related to these Terms. If you reside in one of those countries, the
      laws of your home country may apply to those disputes.

      20. Severability
      If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these Terms and
      not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

      21. Additional terms for specific Services
      Given the breadth of our Services, we sometimes need to craft additional terms and conditions for specific
      Services. Those additional terms and conditions, which will be presented to you before you access the relevant
      Services, then become part of your agreement with us when you accept them. If any part of those additional terms
      and conditions conflicts with these Terms, the additional terms and conditions will prevail.

      22. Final terms
      These Terms make up the entire agreement between you and Snap Group Limited and supersede any prior agreements.
      These Terms do not create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights.
      If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.
      We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
      You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent.
